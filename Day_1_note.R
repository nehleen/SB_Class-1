## Arithmatic operation

# Addition:

2 + 2

# Subtraction:

2 - 2

# Multiplication:

2 * 2

# Division:

2/2

# Conclusion: R can mimic the functionality of a calculator that-
# Any arithmathical operations can be done by R in numerical data type.

# Values and Variables
# Do you know how to assign values to a variable?
# Now we will consider two signs = or <- they are the tools to assign values to a variable.
# While coading == (double quote) has a special meaning. To avoid that confusion we prefer using <- sign always
# Data and Data type or nature of the data or what kind of data is stored inside the variable?
# When we assign some value to a variable it becomes a data and it is stored in the environment.
# If we want to know what type of values are stored inside a data we will use a function called 
# [class]
# when we try to determine the type of data that are stored under a variable we use the function class,
# A variable can store 3 types of data - 1. numerical, 2. charecter [assignment should be using ""; double quote], 3. boolean [True/False]
# There are different ways of storing information into a variable, based on the complexity of the stored data within a variables, we can classify the variables.
# The variables can be classified as - vector, object, matrix, list etc.
# IF WE TRY TO CLASSIFY VARIABLES [data storage system/dataframe] => we have object, scaler, vector, matrix, list etc.
# How do we name a vector?
# Vector => 1 dimensional
# Matrix => 2 dimensional
# Error => the command was not run
# Error Massege => the command was run but it was not properly run something went wrong
# Limitation of matrix is they work with same datatype either all numerical or all character or all boolean if not they convert all to same type. eg.- all numerical data are converted to character for a single character element
# Where dataframe can store different datatypes but it becomes challenging when your are handeling big data.
